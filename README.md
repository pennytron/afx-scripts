# After Effects scripts to optimise workflows

These are just some After Effects scripts I've made to optimise my, and my teams, workflows. They are small, but they might help!  
See [SCRIPTS-LIST](https://github.com/pennytron/afx-scripts/blob/a5e106176579b9efcbf20983a77028607e8ec01a/SCRIPTS-LIST.md) for descriptions.

# Free & Open, For the Community

These scripts were made with one goal in mind: For my team, and myself, to work **smarter**, not _harder_, when using After Effects. These scripts are 100% free and open-source because I believe in sharing knowledge, helping each other grow, and making tools that benefit everyone.

🔓 What This Means for You:  

✅ You can modify them for yourself or your team.  
✅ You can learn from them, tweak them, and make them work best for your workflow.  
✅ You can share those modifications stress-free within your team.  
❌ You can’t take them, change the name, or sell them as your own product. That’s not in the spirit of open-source.  

💡 The Open-Source Promise

These scripts are licensed under GPLv3, which means:

If you modify and share this outside your team, those changes must also stay open-source under GPLv3.  
The community thrives when we all contribute back.  
No one should lock away this knowledge behind a paywall.  

I was inspired by the philosophy behind DUIK—that tools made for creatives should stay accessible, open, and community-driven.

So, if these scripts help you, inspires you, or makes your workflow smoother, pay it forward. Share your knowledge. Help others. Keep the open-source spirit alive. ✨  

Enjoy, and happy scripting!
